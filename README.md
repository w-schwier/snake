# Snake in Python

The purpose of this program is to re-teach myself some basic python concepts by following a tutorial for something fun, that I know I'll be able to stay engaged with.

Having looked through the tutorial I have identified a few areas I want to improve:
* Once the game has ended, e.g. When the player hits his body, the window closes before the user can see their score.
* The snake moves faster going vertically than it does sideways, something I want to address.
* Maybe add the option to manually set the speed; which could result in a higher score for each food collected.
